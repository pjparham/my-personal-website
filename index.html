        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Greenville, SC. I am currently living in Charleston, SC. I graduated from the University of South Carolina in 2019 with a BA in Public Relations. My last job was in corporate sales. While I had a great experience, I learned more about the industry and decided it was not for me. Immense research on where I could go with my career eventually lead me to pursuing Software Engineering at FlatIron. I am very excited to see where this journey takes me!</p>

<!--So my plan for this is to create at least three sections:
-about me
-??
-?? 
I want to make it so that only the headings show up, but when you click them the content will show up under them (does this mean that I will need to put the content of these sections in my js file or HTML file??)
Also just for a fun touch I want to make it so the heading/maybe all the colors of the site change when the heading is clicked
